My name is Carl Viberg, I'm 21 years old and I'm currently studying at [lnu](https://lnu.se/).
At my spare time you'll often find me behind a screen of some sort, and it's been like that for
a really long time. I spent my time in upper secondary school studying IT related courses at
[ITG](http://it-gymnasiet.se/vara-skolor/uppsala/). Technology is my passion and therefor I thought 
it would be a good idea to make it my career as well. After all, you know what they say, right?

*"Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."*

Maybe it's just wishful thinking and after a while every job become a daily grind, but I think
there's something to it.
